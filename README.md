IntelliJ IDEA keybindings for Atom

Keymap files are encoded as JSON or CSON files containing nested hashes. They work much like stylesheets, but instead of applying style properties to elements matching the selector, they specify the meaning of keystrokes on elements matching the selector. 
You can read more Atom's keymaps [here](https://atom.io/docs/v0.60.0/advanced/keymaps)

# Usage

Just copy the contents of the keymap.cson file to the one found in atom.
